Minimum Degree reordering algorithm. Loosely speaking it is applicable for
sparse Symmetric Quasi-SemiDefinite (SQSD) Cholesky factorizations.

### Dependencies
There are no dependencies for installation of the headers.

But running the example drivers requires previous installation of the
header-only command-line processing C++14 library
[specify](https://gitlab.com/hodge_star/specify).

The build system for the examples uses [meson](http://mesonbuild.com) and
the unit tests use [Catch2](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2).

### Quickstart
Please see the
[quickstart documentation](https://hodgestar.com/quotient/docs/master/quickstart.html)
